# Task: Build a Responsive Login Form with Data Table

## Description:

You are tasked with creating a responsive React application using TypeScript that includes a login form and a subsequent
data table page. The login form should include simple validation for the username and password inputs. Upon successful
validation, the user should be redirected to a page displaying a table populated with data from the Star Wars API.

## Requirements:

### Login Form:

- Create a responsive login form with two input fields: one for the username and another for the password.
- Implement basic validation to ensure that neither the username nor the password fields are empty and include
between 4 to 30 characters.
Login Button:
- Include a login button that should be disabled when the validation is not successful.

### React-Router Navigation:

- Utilize react-router-dom for navigation.
- Upon successful login, navigate the user to a new page (e.g., "/table").

### Data Table Page:
- Create a new page ("/table") that displays a table.
- Fetch data from the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.py4e.com/api/people) to populate the table.
- Display the following fields from each object in the API response: name, mass, height, hair color, and skin color.
- Implement basic pagination for the table.

### Table Design:
- Design the table to be visually appealing and responsive.

### Features:
- Loading State: Display a loading state while fetching data from the API.
- Table: implement a basic caching mechanism using the browsers build in local storage (include a simple cache
validation logic as well).
- Error Handling: Implement error handling for failed API requests.
- Implement a feature that will notify the user if his connection is down displaying a modal with an image inside
(should be simulated/tested via the dev-tools network options when the user’s browser makes a fetch request)

## Evaluation Criteria:
**Functionality:** Does the login form perform basic validation? Is the redirection to the data table page working correctly?

Is the data table populated with information from the API?

**Responsiveness:** Is the login form and the data table page responsive for various screen sizes?

**Code Quality:** Is the code well-organized, readable, and following best practices? Are React Hooks used appropriately for
state management and side effects?

**Features:** Are the features implemented and enhance the overall user experience?

**Project Completion:** The front-end development task should be completed within a maximum timeframe of two days from
the date of assignment. Please create a GitHub repository for the project and submit the completed task via the provided
repository link.
